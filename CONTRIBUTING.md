Since this is a "tutorial" project -- and since Julia is, whilst a fabulous tool for messing with GRU/LSTM code, currently less than ideal for mass deployment -- I'm mostly keen to see what I can learn.

I'm appalled to say there are _no tests_. Nada. Zilch. The output is also still incomplete - TODOs in the source - and fixing these, as well as working out the delights of the Pkg / PkgTemplates / PkgSkeleton systems will be next up.

I might also play with Pluto.jl as a frontend... because the idea of an interactive notebook as a UI is rather amusing...

### But... why _Julia_?

Because it's actually quite funky - lots of splendidly Ruby- and Lisp-inspired syntax, a wonderfully mathematical paradigm, insanely fast production code, and with Flux.jl, a rather beautiful ML framework. 

And multiple despatch is remarkably smart.

And because writing it in Rust seemed seriously OTT...



Have fun with it!
